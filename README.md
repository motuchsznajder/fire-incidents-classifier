# Toronto Fire Incidents
## Feature Engineering for ML & AI

Our goal is to improve a classifier performance using feature engineering. We used the Toronto Fire Incidents data set to predict if an incident had a civilian casualty or not.

### Data sets
- **Toronto Fire Incidents**: contains information about Toronto fire incidents, alarm system and sprinklers on the premises, type of building/business, and impact of the incident
- **Stations**: each Toronto station with latitude and longitude information. Used to get nearest station from the incident
- **Hydrants**: similar to the station data set, contains geographic information. Used to get the nearest hydrant from the incident site
- **Ward profile**: used to get information on population density and number of building by type
